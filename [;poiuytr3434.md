This is the public repo for the iOS app ShoppingSorted

ShoppingSorted is a simple Shopping List app, which has the features:
- When adding an item to the shopping list, 'unit' and 'aisle' are also selected (along with quantity). The Unit and Aisle are then selected by default when next adding that item
- When presenting the shopping list, items are grouped by 'aisle', and alson collated by common 'units' (i.e. quantities for the same unit are added together
- 'Meals' (in essence a list of ingredeints) can be saved so as to faciliatte easy adding (to the shopping list) of that meal's ingredients
